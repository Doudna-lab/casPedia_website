          <div id="Info3" class="wiki-hide">
          <p>As a centralized repository of Class 2 Cas systems, CasPEDIA is organized in wiki format, with detailed summaries of each nuclease. Additional resources exist, such as "Advanced Tool Search" and DELTA-BLAST sequence search (default parameters), to assist users in searching for enzymes relevant to their experimental and discovery needs. The website also details the phylogenetic classifications of Class 2 systems, complimenting similar efforts in the CRISPR community. When information is available, wiki entries contain the following sections:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><b>Quick Links:</b> Three summary panels are available at the top of the website to enable rapid access to information about the nuclease. The three panels include: Classification (CasID information), Properties (essential details, including: protospacer length, PAM/PFS sequence, CDS Length, Number of Amino acids, etc.) and Resources (external links to: RefSeq Genome Assembly for the species of origin, RefSeq Gene ID, RefSeq Protein ID, UniProtKB ID, Conserved Domains Database ID(s), etc.)</li>

          <li><b>Summary:</b>Brief summary of the nuclease, including its species of origin, context of its discovery, common uses, novel properties, etc.</li>

          <li><b>Applications: </b>Description of how the Cas nuclease is utilized by scientists. This section contains literature reviews and sub-headers for Gene Editing, Tools and Diagnostics, and Engineered Variants, associated with the effector.</li>

          <li><b>Experimental Considerations:</b> A high-level introduction on how to perform and design experiments with a specific Cas system. This section contains subheadings for "Delivery" (how to deliver a cas nuclease into a system or model organism using different modalities.) and "Design" (now to design guides against a target sequence with established rules or algorithms, create an expression construct for the nuclease, and other relevant notes to kickstart experimentation.).</li>

          <li><b>Nucleotide Sequence:</b> A genome-browser view of the nuclease's sequence and architecture of its CRISPR array. Both the nucleotide sequence and genomic coordinates are available for download.</li>

          <li><b>Protein Structure:</b> A summary of domain and residue information from UNIPROT and Pfam, with structures from PDB or generated with AlphaFold2.</li>

          <li><b>References:</b> All information in CasPEDIA should be accompanied by a citation. The citations for each wiki are indexed at the bottom of the page in APA style.</li>

          <div id="CasID1" class="wiki-hide">
            <p class="section-content">The <a href="http://caspedia.org/" target="_blank">homepage of the website </a> provides a detailed description of the CasID system. CasIDs are identification numbers that demarcate the functional properties of each nuclease. Inspired by the EC system (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enzyme_commission_nUmber" Target="_blank">enzyme Commission numbers</a>), CasIDs are comprised of 3 digits. Briefly, the first digit represents Nuclease Activity, the second value indicates the Targeting Requirements of the RNA-guided enzyme, and the third digit summarizes the Guide RNA (gRNA) Design and Multiplexing properties of a nuclease. Across Class 2 systems, there are 9 distinct forms of Nuclease Activity, 7 different Targeting Requirements and 5 unique classes of gRNA Design and Multiplexing considerations.</p>

          <div id="CasID2" class="wiki-hide">
            <p class="section-content"><p>CasIDs can be interpreted using the lookup table on the <a href="http://caspedia.org/" target="_blank">homepage of the website </a>. Assessing the three constituent digits of an ID, reveals the nuclease's function. The first integer describes the Nuclease Activity of the enzyme, of which there are 9 distinct types, covering both cis and trans properties. The second value indicates the Targeting Requirements of the RNA-guided enzyme, spanning 7 different types. The third digit summarizes 5 unique classes of Guide RNA (gRNA) Design and Multiplexing properties for Class 2 systems.</p>

            <p>To better understand CasIDs, consider SpyCas9a, with a CasID of 1.1.1.</p>
            <ul class="ul-ul">
              <li>The Nuclease Activity for this enzyme falls under category 1, implying it has blunt double-strand cis nuclease-activity, and no trans nuclease-activity.<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.11.021" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.</li>
              <li>The Targeting Requirements for SpyCas9a fit category 1, meaning it requires a 3' protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM)</li>
              <li>Finally, the Guide RNA (gRNA) Design and Multiplexing properties for this enzyme fall under category 1, such that the native CRISPR array for SpyCas9a requires a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for targeting + a trans-acting crRNA (tracrRNA) for multiplexing to the protein backbone of the effector + additional factors for processing the array into mature guides. SpyCas9a can also be engineered to utilize a minimal array containing different single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), represented as a contiguous, all-in-one crRNA + tracrRNA sequence.<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09886" target="_blank">2,</a></sup><sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-062215-010822" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.</li>

            <p class="section-content"><p>Using the website navigation menu, select "Advanced Tool Search". This redirects to a new page that guides users through a series of drop-down menus, which ultimately generate a table of all Class 2 systems that possess the experimentalist's properties of choice. To elaborate, Advanced Tool Search requires four user-inputted selections: Cis-Activity Substrate, Trans-Activity Substrate, Targeting Requirements and gRNA Design and Multiplexability. Dropdown panels exist for each of the 4 categories and their contents mirror the functional categories allotted to CasIDs. From each dropdown menu, users click which properties they desire and also have the option to select "Any" for categories where an enzyme's functions is flexible.</p>

          <div id="Search6" class="wiki-hide wiki-black">
            <p class="section-content"><p>The CasPEDIA search bar can be used to search for cas enzymes by protein sequence (e.g. SpySas9a, Cas9, Cas13, etc.), using an underlying DELTA-BLAST function that queries against all sequences deposited in CasPEDIA. All sequence-searches most follow fasta syntax (i.e. > sequenceName\n seqeuncestr)Searches are not case-sensitive, and, aside from the that must proceed each sequence, search strings should exclude special characters (e.g. *, white space, line-breaks and punctuation marks). Currently, only one sequence can be inputted at a single time. Currently, the DELTA-BLAST parameters for the search tool are fixed (cannot be edited during runtime) and set to the tool's default settings. If you would like to perform extended BLAST searches, all protein sequences in CasPEDIA can be [[downloaded here]] for external searches.</p>

            <p>Sequence searches redirect to a search results table, where each row is a unique Type Protein (aka. Nuclease and species) with 6 columns: Hit Name (type protein), Query Length, Hit Length, BLAST Alignment Length, Query Coverage (%) and PAM. The table is sortable (both ascending and descending ) by all fields in the table, include E-value, to assist users in finding their desired nuclease.</p>

            <p>If a BLAST search does not yield any hits, no significant hits against the CasPEDIA database were found, or the input did not adhere to fasta format (please check the input). If the formatting for a failed search was correct and you discovered an entry you'd like to add to CasPEDIA, we'd be happy to help--please see the FAQ section entitled "Update or contribute to CasPEDIA" as well as the Contact page of the website for more information.</p>

To this end, scientists can leverage the DELTA-BLAST search engine to identify the CasPEDIA entry with the highest sequence-similarity (lowest e-value) to their novel protein. The top DELTA-BLAST hit may have similar function to the candidate protein and the functional information embedded in its CasID can be used to inform a preliminary set of experiments to efficiently characterize the true nature of the novel nuclease.
