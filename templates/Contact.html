      <h2 class="section-header">BECOME A CUTATOR</h2>
      <p>We are grateful for your interest--casPEDIA is a community resource and your participation is welcome! 
        Anyone can contribute to the database. If you would like to become a curator (i.e. create and edit wiki content), send a message to <Insert Contact> with the subject header "Request to Become General Curator" and a small summary of your research and/or CRISPR experience. 
        Our team will followup with next steps on how to formalize the process and guage your interest on specific wiki features that need your attention.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header">REQUEST A NEW ENTRY</h2>
      <p>If you would like to suggest a new casPEDIA entry, contact caspediaadmins[at]google.com with the subject line "Request for new casPEDIA Entry: [New Entry Name]." Novel cas nucleases will be considered for the wiki, if the enzyme's function is described in 1 or more peer-reviewed publications and there is sufficient information to complete the webpage. We are also happy to work with CRISPR pioneers with papers under submission/revision and are willing to contribute to the curation process themselves. If you are unable to curate content for the entry you suggest, please identify a minimum of 5 scientist who'd be able to assist with the entry. The casPEDIA Consortium will review all potential wiki content to maintain the database's curation standards.</p>
